			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClassParagraph">
				<p>The user interviews consisted of a series of 18 open ended questions that were asked to three different individuals who have worked in the technology industry or majored in a technology related field. My goal for these interviews was to gain some insight from working professionals and those with a technology background on what would be important in a software oriented personal website. From these interviews some items to include on personal website were a link to one’s personal Github since company recruiters could potentially view the website and would be interested in taking a more in depth look at a candidate’s side projects. A recommendation that was given was to either keep the content on a single page or have the content be styled in a way that is minimalistic yet still conveying a strong software skillset.

			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClassParagraph">
				<p>The purpose of the competitor analysis is to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of competitor’s products to help inform an analysis of one’s own product as well as help facilitate certain design decisions. Two of the competitor analysis were found on google when looking for popular portfolio’s and the other portfolio is from an acquaintance who works at a startup. I reviewed these portfolio's since they contained interesting design choices and came up quickly on google which likely indicates they are viewed frequently. For the competitor analysis I evaluated the strengths and weaknesses based on the criteria in the document as well as using my own intuition on the design decisions that were showcased in the website. The main strengths concluded from the websites were the use of backgrounds and images to produce a more aesthetic website and engaging website. There were several interactive links such as social media links and project image links which navigated the user to another page, larger image, or app store. There were not many major weaknesses and the analysis also revealed that personality can be incorporated through unique styling choices while still maintain the essential content. </p></div>

			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClass"><p>Feature Value Matrix</p></div>
			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClassParagraph">
				<p>The purpose of feature value matrix is to map out the most important features for a given project. For the feature value I looked at several different features ranging from contact information, social media links, and essential information that could be found on a resume as well as a few other features. I selected these features after looking at competitors and user research which helped some common things to include in a portfolio website. I also chose these features based on the intended audience which would be technical recruiters from large software companies. Based on the feature value matrix I found that most of the information found on ones personal LinkedIn and personal resume should also be located on one’s website.</p></div>

			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClass"><p>Feature Prioritization List</p></div>
			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClassParagraph">
				<p>The purpose of feature prioritization is to help visualize features of a project ranging by importance. I prioritized features in the diagrams based on the information found in the feature value matrix. The items mapped to high priority sections were things I considered to be essential and should be handled first. Additionally, the feature prioritization validated my decision to focus on overall design less than the actual content. As a result, for the first iteration of the project I added the high-priority sections content and attempted at showcasing some interests/activities without incorporating much styling. Social Media Links were also a low priority which is why the midterm project contained an incomplete version of the links. For the final project I incorporated some of the low-priority features such as icons as links to social media and modifying styling based on user testing. </p></div>

			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClass"><p>User Stories</p></div>
			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClassParagraph">
				<p>The purpose of user stories is to identify features and how the user would utilize those features. They are considered important since they showcase value of a feature from an end-user perspective. I created the user stories by reading up online about how to create user stories from Mike Cohn. I approached the user stories from the perspective of a potential hiring manager or technical recruiter reviewing online portfolios to find a suitable candidate that fulfills a specific position needed in their company. I primarily focused on hiring managers and company recruiters because I am currently looking for a role in a software engineering company and am not trying to promote myself as an individualized service or freelance developer.</p></div>

			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClass"><p>Cognitive Walkthrough</p></div>
			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClassParagraph">
				<p>The purpose of a cognitive walkthrough is to have a user go through a series of tasks followed by a series of questions regarding their experience with those tasks. They are frequently used to gather an understanding of how quickly a user learns to navigate through activities and gain perspective from unfamiliar users of an application. The main challenges when going through the cognitive walkthrough were that parties being interviewed for the cognitive walkthrough did not understand the format and structure of the walkthroughs initially. I explained to the interviewees how to participate in the cognitive walkthrough as well as their purpose. Another challenge was two of the walkthroughs had to be conducted. To conduct the online walkthroughs I had the other party share their screen and proceeded in the same way that would be done in person. Once this was cleared there were not any difficulties in conducting the walkthroughs. The walkthroughs primarily revealed that the content was not difficult to navigate through however the large amount of text on sections such as the About Me page were distracting.</p></div>

			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClass"><p>User Test</p></div>
			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClassParagraph">
				<p>I conducted the Five Second Test and the Portfolio Question Test. The reason I chose these tests is that I wanted to get some qualitative data on the content on my webpage. I did not have many links and the cognitive walkthroughs revealed that users had minimal trouble navigating through the website. As a result, I wanted to focus on how well the information was conveyed to the audience. Based on the question test, users easily understood the purpose of the website and each specific section. The five second test revealed that the text spacing, dark backgrounds, and large blocks of text made it difficult to quickly skim through content. It was recommended to add some styling to resolve this issue and make the website more aesthetic. </p></div>

			<!-- Findings -->
			<div class="UserResearchTestingClass"><p>Summary of Findings</p></div>
			<hr>
			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClassParagraph">
				<p>The user research revealed what features were essential to building a good portfolio website for a person interested in new graduate software positions. The primary features that should be included according to user research were the following: project/work experience section, email contact, personalized photo, skills, and about section. Other features that were noteworthy include an interests section, navigational buttons, links to social media, and design elements. These features were mainly revealed through the feature value matrix and prioritized based on importance in the feature prioritization mapping list. They were also found when viewing websites that were listed in the competitor analysis. The competitor analysis showcased that mostly work and project related content were found on the personal website. Although there was interesting styling choices used on the websites I considered this less important on the first iteration based on the feature value matrix and feature prioritization list. This informed my original design decision to move forward with implementing a straightforward and simplistic design for the first iteration of the website. After developing the first iteration of the website I performed user testing to evaluate the portfolio website.</p>

				<p>The user testing portion helped to showcase how users would be using the website as well as inform me of potential drawbacks from design decisions I chose. A major drawback that was uncovered was that there was too much text located on some sections of the website such as the About Me section. This was revelead as a common complaint and found to be overwhelming to digest by the reader. My original view was to include this much information since I tried to match these sections with a similar format as my personal resume or LinkedIn profile. However, this assumption was proven to be inaccurate after going through usability testing. Since all the primary content was located on the page and there was no difficulty navigating through the website I hypothesized that I should incorporate better styling choices for the final and reduce the volume of content on the overall website. For the future implementation I planned to incorporate better line spacing, change some layouts, remove backgrounds that caused eyestrain, and implement some creative design decisions that could not be accomplished on the first project version.</p>

			<!-- Incorporate Findings -->
			<div class="UserResearchTestingClass"><p>Incorporation of Findings</p></div>
			<hr>
			<div class= "UserResearchTestingSubClassParagraph">
				<p>The first version of the project used extremely minimalistic styling and mostly displayed large amounts of text. Based on the findings the primary goals for the final version of the project was to use styling to make everything more organized and less overwhelming to skim through. I chose to play around with font, spacing, and line options to see how much improvement I could get from it. I found that simply using a different font style, centering, padding options, and font size, and line-spacing options in CSS allowed the content to be displayed much clearer and organized than the first iteration without requiring any significant changes to the content. The About Me Section and the Projects Section benefitted the most since I was able to display the most relevant information in a way that could be skimmed through while also showcasing the most essential features. Some minor adjustments that helped these pages was removing the use of unordered lists and choosing to style skills and projects using div classes. This reduced a lot of eyestrain from having bullets on the page and made the website styling consistent with all other pages. The usability tests revealed that some of the content was difficult to skim so I decided to include much more pictures for the interest’s section to show rather than tell the information to the user. </p>

				<p>Some secondary improvements I decided to make were to change the social media links to icons which ended up looking much cleaner and professional than the text box in the bottom right corner. It was noted in the usability testing that some background images were distracting. This was difficult to assess since there was not much additional comments regarding this. I hypothesized that this was because there was a dark background image which blended in with the dark text container and made it difficult to read information. As a result, I changed the background image to a brighter image which contrasted with the white text. Although the contact section was not reviewed in any of the usability tests I found that upon viewing some other examples of contact pages that it was lacking. Some of the contact pages that were popular I looked up included a city background which informed my decision to use that background. Furthermore, I added direct links to my email and phone number that could be contacted by pressing on them. From looking at the feature prioritization list, and feature value matrix it was important that recruiters could contact me. I made these clickable links so that way recruiters and hiring managers would have less work in reaching me.</p>

				<p>The biggest challenges were dealing with poor design decisions from the first iteration of the project. There was a large amount of redundant CSS. I renamed things and tried to organize them better in the final version of the project so that way it was easier to edit. I struggled with this at first because the css was extremely disorganized however after restructuring one we page it was much easier to follow suite and restructure the other web pages since they would also use similar styling. For the future I would need to think much more on the layout since filling in the content was much easier once the layout was completed as opposed to vice versa. Additionally, I would try to make the website more responsive by having creative animations like animated skills bars since they showcase the information better while using minimal amounts of text.
